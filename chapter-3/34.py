"""
There is a well-known city (which will go nameless here) whose inhabi-
tants have the reputation of enjoying a meal only if that meal is the best
they have ever experienced in their life. Otherwise, they hate it. Assum-
ing meal quality is distributed uniformly across a person's life, describe
the expected number of times inhabitants of this city are happy with their
meals?

Harmonic series: f(n) ~= ln(n) + 0.577 (Euler-Mascheroni constant)

3 meals per day
365 days per year
80 years

total meals = 3*365*80 = 87600

ln(87600) + 0.577 ~= 12 meals
